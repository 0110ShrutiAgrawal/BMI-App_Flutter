# BMI-App_Flutter
Flutter App to calculate BMI of an individual

In a BMI (Body Mass Index) project, the BMI values of individuals are normally determined by evaluating a dataset of their height and weight measurements. Based on the entered numbers, this Flutter-based app calculates a person's BMI and displays the results as overweight, underweight, or the ideal weight. Additionally, the backdrop colour is dynamically altered.
